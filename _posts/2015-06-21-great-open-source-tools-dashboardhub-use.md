Here at **DashboardHub** we use a lot of **Open Source** tools and libraries! Thats why we not only contribute back to these tools in various ways ([ways to support Open Source tools](/2015/06/08/supporting-open-source-projects/)) but also give our Applications & Tools back to the community as **Open Source**.

Lets break this down into sections:

### Communication

Our team works fully remotely, therefore communications and collaboration are key! These tools are vital to **DashboardHub**:

* [Gitter.im](gitter.im) - chat room via the browser
* [Appear.in](appear.in) - video conferencing, includes desktop sharing, all via the browser
*

---

### Static Code (blog, website etc)

* GitHub pages
* Jekyll

---

### Services we use

* GitHub (no explanation needed here, just pure awesomeness)
* Zoho - email hosting
* Doorbell.io - user feedback

---

### Our Micro Service and Friends (main part of DashboardHub)

#### PHP

* PHPStorm
* Composer
* Doctrine
* Symfony2

#### Java

* [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) - all the features of the Spring platform, without all the config hassle
* [JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io/) - A novel way to use GitHub as your maven/gradle repository
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - without doubt the best IDE for just about any language
* [JSONServer / jsonplaceholder](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - handy tool to fake an API for prototyping

#### Clientside

* AngularJS
* Twitter Bootstrap
* FontAwesome


#### Friends

* MySQL - database
* ElasticSearch - search and analytics

---

### DevOPs (a current buzz word, I am still waiting for *DevTestOps* to take off)

* Digital Ocean - simple & fast hosting
* Dokku - private Heroku using Docker (baby brother of DEIS)
* Git - version control and deployment
